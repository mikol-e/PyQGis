# Welcome to my PyQGis repository !

#### I am learning to run Processing tools from PyQGIS and how to chain multiple tools into a workflow within QGis.

#### Here you will find my work in QGis, using PyQGis to write code and Google Earth Engines for satellite imagery. Combining this powerful tools it turns out mapping is not that hard ! And the best part is, in this way, data can be easily transformed much richer ponds of information. Like Lago Titicaca in Per√∫, it is known not because how big the lake is but because it is the deepest. And who would have guessed, it was formed at the crater of a dormant volcano !
