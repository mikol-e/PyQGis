# Welcome to my PyQGis repository !

#### I am learning to run Processing tools from PyQGIS and how to chain multiple tools into a workflow within QGis.

##### Here you will find my work in QGis, using PyQGis to write code and Google Earth Engines for satellite imagery. 

##### Combining this powerful tools it turns out mapping is not that hard ! And the best part is, in this way, data can be easily transformed much richer ponds of information.
### Like Lago Titicaca in Per√∫, the lake is known not because how large it is, but because of its location and deepth. It was formed at the crater of a dormant volcano. Who would have guessed it is the deepest in the world !
